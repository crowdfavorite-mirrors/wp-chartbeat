= What does this plugin do? =

It’s an easy way for you to install the Chartbeat code you need in order to see what's happening on your WordPress site in real time. Make sure you [sign up for Chartbeat](http://chartbeat.com/signup) and have an active account first, or this plugin won’t work for your site.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

Nope. Chartbeat code is completely asynchronous, meaning it doesn't begin to run until everything else on your page has already loaded.
